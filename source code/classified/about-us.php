					<h1 class="text-color-blue">Let's talk about DTUhub</h1>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<p>DTUhub came into existence when, we realized that after the end of every semester or year
						, many things become useless for us – from old syllabus books to previous class notes, electronic gadgets to PG accommodations.
					 Is it not possible to reuse these things in a constructive and profitable way? Thing which are of no use to us can be in the “wanted” list of many. 
					Here is when DTUhub comes into picture.
					Generally, we sell our old books at a book store which returns half of the cost price; dump loads of Xerox and notes into dustbins.
					 We may no more need an electrical/electronic gadget and instead of considering it as a potential asset, we dump it as a liability. 
					 After the discussion over a few mugs of coffee we came up with the plan of a marketplace.
					<br/><br/>
					A marketplace that is specifically designed for seamless trading among the students. 
					DTUhub- A Student to Student Marketplace will give you the option to sell, buy, swap or donate your assets.
					 It is not limited to book or notes, a seller/buyer can ask for anything from the wide variety of categories. 
					  Whatever DTUhub is, we know is not the best, but every day we try to make your experience better.  </p>

					<h2 class="text-color-blue">Now comes the question – Why DTUhub? <br/>There are 3 very simple answers to these: </h2>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
					<p>It is exclusively to cater to the needs of college students. It is the first website which provides the platform to sell and buy old books, notes, electronic gadgets, to ask for a room (PG) or a roommate and endless needs of college students. Moreover, instead of just posting an ad as a seller, you may post an ad as a buyer.
						<br /><br />
					We are just a channel between buyer and seller – we don’t charge you anything i.e., we don’t take any commissions. For instance, a book (even if it was bought as a second hand book) which was initially bought at Rs. 500 will be taken back by the same shopkeeper at not more than half the price (Rs. 250 in this case). The same shopkeeper will resale the book at Rs. 350 (let’s say) and will keep a profit Rs. 100 in his pocket. However, by using DTUhub, the seller can sell his book for Rs. 300 and there will be numerous buyers to grab the book since it is Rs.50 cheaper than what the shopkeeper was asking for. In a nutshell, money instead of going into the middleman’s (shopkeeper’s) pocket, may be divided among the buyer and seller, hence profit for both. In case you want to sell something for free, you may do so as well!!
					<br /><br />
					It helps you reuse the “no-more-in-use” materials to prove boon to you and to the buyer. Helps reduce wastage and above all, keeps your cupboard clean!!
					<br /><br />
					Whatever DTUhub is, we know is not the best, but every day we try to make your experience better.  And now the question is why did we choose name this website as DTUhub? What does DTUhub mean? Since it is a long story, you will get the answer in one of our blog section.
